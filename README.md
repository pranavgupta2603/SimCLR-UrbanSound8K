# SimCLR Implementation for UrbanSound8K Classification 🎵🏙️🤖

## Introduction
This project implements the **SimCLR** (Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Visual Representations) architecture for the classification of urban sounds using the **UrbanSound8K** dataset. The goal is to accurately classify different urban sounds like sirens, car horns, etc., using advanced deep learning techniques.

## Dataset 📁
The dataset used for this project is the [UrbanSound8K dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranked03/urbansound8k-mel-spectrogram-images). This dataset consists of Mel-Spectrogram images, which are a visual representation of the audio data, suitable for our SimCLR model.

## Code for Audio to Spectrogram Conversion 🔄
The conversion of audio to Mel-Spectrogram images is performed using a code available in this GitHub repository: [UrbanSound8k-MelSpectrogram](https://github.com/pranavgupta2603/UrbanSound8k-MelSpectrogram). This is crucial for preparing the dataset in a format that our model can process.

## Architecture 🏗️
- **SimCLR Framework**: A self-supervised learning model used to learn representations of audio data.
- **Classifier**: A neural network that classifies audio based on the representations learned by SimCLR.

## Hyperparameters ⚙️
- **Epochs**: 15
- **Number of Folds**: 10 (Cross-validation approach)
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001
- **Weight Decay**: 1e-6
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Loss Function**: NTXentLoss (Contrastive Loss)

## Outputs 📊
The model was trained across multiple folds, showing consistent improvement in accuracy. Here are some highlights:
- **Validation Accuracy**: Ranges around 65% to 81%, varying across different epochs and folds.

## Conclusion 🎉
This implementation showcases the effectiveness of SimCLR in a non-traditional domain like urban sound classification. The model achieves promising results, illustrating the power of self-supervised learning in audio processing.
